# GYM_managementSystemACP

GYM Management System The project will be a gym management system which will be managed and used by either a staff member or client. The client will only have access to his own data, while the staff will have access to all the data. This app will aid the process of managing all the clients that are willing to join the gym and having different needs. The app will also be widely used since the gym numbers are increasing. The client will have access to only his own data in a different app than the one used by the staff members. some of those data that the client will have access to are (membership class, the clientâ€™s class) however the client is unable to modify the available information.
